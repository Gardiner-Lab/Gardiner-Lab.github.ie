### 2. **Antibiotic Dissolution:**

For each antibiotic, prepare the stock solution using the following procedure:

1. **Select the appropriate antibiotic** and refer to the working concentration from the table below:
  
   | **Antibiotic**      | **Stock Solution (mg/ml)** | **Solvent**             | **Working Concentration (µg/ml)** |
   |--------------------|----------------------------|-------------------------|-----------------------------------|
   | Ampicillin          | 50                         | Distilled Water (H₂O)    | 50                                |
   | Carbenicillin       | 100                        | H₂O or 50% EtOH          | 100                               |
   | Chloramphenicol     | 35                         | EtOH or MetOH            | 35                                |

   | Hygromycin B**      | 50                         | H₂O                      | 35                                |
   | Kanamycin           | 50                         | H₂O                      | 50                                |
   | Nalidixic acid      | 30                         | H₂O (pH 11 w/ NaOH)      | 30                                |
   | Neomycin            | 10                         | H₂O                      | 800 (80 µl/ml)                    |
   | Rifampicin**        | 10                         | Methanol (MetOH)         | 10                                |
   | Streptomycin        | 100                        | H₂O                      | 100                               |
   | Tetracycline***     | 10                         | 70% Ethanol (EtOH)       | 10                                |

   | Trimethoprim        | 10                         | DMSO                     | 10                                |
  
   2. Using the analytical balance, **accurately weigh the amount of antibiotic powder** in grams, according to the required stock concentration from the table.
   
   3. **Dissolve in the appropriate solvent** (as indicated in the table). For light-sensitive antibiotics (marked with ** or ***), cover the tubes in aluminum foil once dissolved.

### 3. **Sterilization and Filtering:**

   Most antibiotic stock solutions should be **filter-sterilized**:
   
   1. **Prepare a sterile syringe filter** attached to a 0.22 µm filter membrane (preferably nylon if using DMSO; avoid cellulose acetate membranes with DMSO).
   
   2. **Filter the antibiotic solution** into a sterile 50ml falcon tube. Use a pipette to transfer the solution for filtering if volume is small.

### 4. **Aliquoting, Storage, and Labeling:**

   1. Once filtered, **aliquot the solution** into sterile tubes (1 ml per tube is common for ease of use).
   
   2. **Label each tube** with:
      - Antibiotic name
      - Date of preparation
      - Concentration
      - Storage conditions (light sensitive, -20°C or +4°C as indicated in the table).

   3. Store the antibiotic stock solution:
      - Most solutions are stored at **-20°C** in aliquots.
      - Working stocks for antibiotics like **Kanamycin, D-cycloserine** may be stored at **+4°C**.

---

### 5. **Use in Media Preparation:**

   When preparing media with antibiotics:

   - **Thaw the aliquot** and vortex if needed.
   - **Add 1 ml of the antibiotic stock to 1 liter of media** (for a typical 1000X dilution).
   - Ensure **media has cooled to ~55-60°C** post-autoclaving before adding the antibiotic to avoid inactivation.

---

## 4. Light-Sensitive Antibiotics:

   **Wrap the following antibiotics in aluminum foil after dissolving, as they are light-sensitive**:

   - Hygromycin B
   - Rifampicin
   - Tetracycline

---

## 5. Storage & Notes:

   - Solutions with solvents like DMSO require specific **storage temperatures** and filters.
   - Always **prepare unstable antibiotic solutions fresh** to avoid degradation over time.
