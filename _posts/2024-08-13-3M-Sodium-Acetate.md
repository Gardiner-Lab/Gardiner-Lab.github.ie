# 3M Sodium Acetate (CH3COONa) Preparation Protocol at pH 4.8
---

## 1. Purpose:
This protocol guides the preparation of a 3M Sodium Acetate (CH3COONa) solution with a pH of 4.8, which is commonly used in various laboratory applications.

## 2. Materials:
* Chemicals:
   * **Sodium Acetate Trihydrate (CH3COONa·3H2O)**
   * **Concentrated Acetic acid (CH3COOH)**
   * **H2O (Water)**

* Equipment:
   * **Weighing scale**
   * **pH meter**
   * **Autoclave**

* Personal Protective Equipment (PPE):
   * Lab coat
   * Gloves
   * Safety glasses

## 3. Procedure:
1. **Preparation of Sodium Acetate (CH3COONa):** Weigh **408.1 g** of Sodium Acetate Trihydrate (CH3COONa·3H2O) using an appropriate weighing scale.
2. **Dissolution:** Add the Sodium Acetate to **less than 500 ml** of water. Note, it takes a large amount of Acetic acid (CH3COOH) to adjust the pH so start with a lesser volume of water.
3. **pH Adjustment:** Use concentrated Acetic acid (CH3COOH) to adjust the pH of the solution to **4.8**. Continue adding Acetic acid to the solution until the desired pH is achieved.
4. **Volume Adjustment to Make 3M Solution:** Add more water to the solution until the final volume is **1 liter**. 408.1 g in 1 liter of solution gives a concentration approximately equal to 3M.
5. **Sterilization:** Autoclave the solution to achieve sterility. This should be done at **121°C** for **15 minutes**.
