##0.5s MS Salts Media with MES Buffer Protocol


---

**1. Purpose:

This protocol outlines the preparation of Murashige and Skoog (MS) salts media supplemented with MES buffer, which is suitable for plant tissue culture applications.

**2. Materials:

* Chemicals:
    * MS Salts powder (includes macro and micronutrients)
    * MES hydrate powder (2-(N-morpholino) ethane sulfonic acid)
    * Potassium hydroxide solution (0.5 M KOH)
    * Plant Agar powder

 * Equipment:
     * Analytical balance
     * Magnetic stirrer and stirring bar
     * Graduated cylinder (3 L) 
     * Volumetric flasks (2.5 L, 500 ml x multiple)
     * pH meter with calibration solutions
     * Beaker
     * Pipette
     * Autoclave

 * Personal Protective Equipment (PPE):
    * Lab coat
    * Gloves
    * Safety glasses

 **3. Procedure:


**1.  Preparation: Clean and dry all glassware thoroughly.

**2.  Dissolving MS Salts & MES:
    Using the analytical balance, Weigh 6.45 g of MS salts powder and 1.5 g of MES hydrate powder.

    Transfer these powders to a clean beaker containing approximately 2 L of distilled water.
    Place the beaker on a magnetic stirrer and stir continuously until both powders are completely dissolved.

**3.  pH Adjustment:
    Carefully calibrate the pH meter using standard calibration solutions according to the manufacturer's instructions.

    Slowly add 0.5 M KOH solution to the MS salts/MES mixture while stirring continuously, monitoring the pH with the calibrated pH meter.
    Aim to adjust the pH to a range of 5.6-5.8. Record the final volume after pH adjustment.


**4.  Final Volume Adjustment:

    Carefully transfer the adjusted solution to a clean 3 L volumetric flask.
    Add distilled water to the flask until the meniscus reaches 3L. Mix thoroughly.

**5.   Aliquoting and Agar Addition:

     Aliquot the prepared MS media into multiple sterile 500 ml bottles.
     To each bottle, add 4 g of plant agar powder. This will result in a final concentration of 0.8% agar after autoclaving.

**6.   Sterilization: Autoclave all bottles containing the MS media and agar at 121Â°C for 15 minutes to sterilize them.

**7.  Agar Mixing: After autoclaving, carefully invert each bottle several times to ensure the agar is evenly distributed.

**8.  Storage & Use: Allow the sterilized bottles to cool down to room temperature (RT). Store them at RT until needed. Before use, microwave each bottle for a short period, carefully monitoring it, to melt the agar and create a homogeneous solution.
