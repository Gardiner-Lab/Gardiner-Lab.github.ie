# 0.5x MS Media with MES Buffer Protocol

---

## 1. Purpose:

This protocol outlines the preparation of 0.5x Murashige and Skoog (MS) salts media supplemented with MES buffer, which is suitable for plant tissue culture applications.

---

## 2. Materials:

### * Chemicals:
- MS Salts powder (includes macro and micronutrients)
- MES hydrate powder (2-(N-morpholino) ethane sulfonic acid)
- Potassium hydroxide solution (0.5 M KOH)
- Plant Agar powder

### * Equipment:
- Analytical balance
- Magnetic stirrer and stirring bar
- Graduated cylinder (3 L)
- Volumetric flasks (2.5 L, 500 ml x multiple)
- pH meter with calibration solutions
- Beaker
- Pipette
- Autoclave

### * Personal Protective Equipment (PPE):
- Lab coat
- Gloves
- Safety glasses

## 3. Procedure:

### 1. **Preparation:**

   Thoroughly clean and dry all glassware before beginning the protocol.

---

### 2. **Dissolving MS Salts & MES:**

1. Using the analytical balance, **weigh 6.45 g of MS salts powder** and **1.5 g of MES hydrate powder**.
   
2. Transfer these weighed powders to a clean beaker containing approximately **2 L of distilled water**.
   
3. Place the beaker on a magnetic stirrer and stir continuously until both powders are completely dissolved.

---

### 3. **pH Adjustment:**

1. Carefully **calibrate the pH meter** using standard calibration solutions following the manufacturer’s instructions.

2. Slowly add **0.5 M KOH** solution to the MS salts/MES mixture while stirring continuously. Monitor the pH with the calibrated pH meter.

3. Adjust the pH to a range of **5.6-5.8**. **Record the final volume** after pH adjustment for accurate results.

---

### 4. **Final Volume Adjustment:**

1. Carefully transfer the adjusted solution to a clean **3 L volumetric flask**.
   
2. Add **distilled water** to the flask until the **meniscus reaches 3 L**. Mix thoroughly to ensure homogeneity.

---

### 5. **Aliquoting and Agar Addition:**

1. Aliquot the prepared MS media into multiple sterile **500 ml bottles**.

2. To each bottle, add **4 g of plant agar powder**. This will ensure a final agar concentration of **0.8%** after autoclaving.

---

### 6. **Sterilization:**

1. Autoclave all bottles containing the MS media and agar at **121°C for 15 minutes** to sterilize the solution.

---

### 7. **Agar Mixing:**

1. After autoclaving, carefully **invert each bottle several times** to ensure the agar is evenly distributed within the solution while it's still hot.

---

### 8. **Storage & Use:**

1. Allow the sterilized bottles to **cool down to room temperature (RT)**.

2. Store the bottles at RT until needed.

3. **Before use**, microwave each bottle for a short period, carefully monitoring it, to melt the agar and create a homogeneous solution.
